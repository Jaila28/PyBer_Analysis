# PyBer_Analysis


Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to gather information on the total weekly fares for Pyber in 3 different city types.
Pyber operates in Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities. Initially I was to gather data on ride counts, average number of drivers, and average fare
prices per ride in each city type. I was able to formulate a comparison of all three. I created a summary data frame that presents the average 
fare per driver, the average fare per rider, total fares, and total amount of drivers.


Results

In the following data frame, it shows that the more total rides where performed, the more drivers were present. This explains why the average
total amount of fares collected was higher for Urban Cities then in other cities. In the rural areas where there are less drivers and less rides 
provided, there was a smaller amount in total fares collected. The number of average rides and average fare per driver was higher in the rural 
areas due to being further away from the cities that were more densly populated. However in the more Urban and Suburban areas which are more populated, 
I noticed that the total amount of drivers where higher but the average fare prices per ride and per driver was lower. This could be attributed to 
thier being shorter trips taken over a period of time.

**Summary**

I created a line chart to give a visulaization of the Total fare by city type over a period 4 month. Through doing so I was able to find out that the'
number of rides increase for a slight period of time at the end of febuary for all three city types. Then after that line chart shows that each city type
experiences fluctuations. I also notice that during the month of January, that the total fares by city types where at their lowest. Based on this 
informaiton it I think that it is safe to assume that during the summer month an increase in total fares can be expected. And as it gets colder
during the fall and winter months the totals fare will decrease.
